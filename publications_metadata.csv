Mayawati Government Girls PG College Badalpur,,Co-Author,"Polycystic ovarian disease and cancers of the ovaries and uterus are common gynecological diseases, increasingly affecting even rural communities. These conditions pose significant challenges in rural India due to a lack of awareness, high screening costs, and ignorance of symptoms. This cross-sectional, community-based study assessed the prevalence of gynecological disorders and awareness among women aged 18–55 years in Lal Kuan, Badalpur, and Achheja, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. The study revealed a gynecological disturbance prevalence of 31.7%. Menstrual irregularities affected 28.6% of participants, and 12% reported polycystic ovary syndrome. Alarmingly, 73% of women did not seek medical care for such issues due to hesitation and various sociocultural barriers. This highlights the urgent need for awareness programs and affordable healthcare interventions in rural communities.",Gynecological disorders|Polycystic ovarian disease|Irregular periods|Menstrual cycle irregularities|Rural health awareness,English,Connect Journals,DST-CURIE,Women Scientists' Grant 2023,"Antonio, A., Sandro, L.V., Rocco, R., Alessandra, G., Rossella, E.N., Aldo, E. and Alberto, F.
